Y'know
majority of parents in India force their kids to become doctors or engineers because they are "well paying jobs"
My parents (especially my mother) never forced me
They always wanted me to pursue what I like
It just so happened that I like tech, the most sought after domain
And the entrance for a B.Tech in a reputable institute is really tough
and they ask question from physics, chemistry and maths
And even in school, since I was just so passionate about Comp. Sci., I never paid attention to other subjects
my parents knew that I was devoting much more time to CS than I should
My mother advised me to only study decent enough CS and focus on entrance specific subjects
And she had a point
But me being me
I didn't
And my personality wasn't really "female-friendly" if that makes sense
because girls my age liked makeup, relationships, celebrities
and my interests were latest technology and code
So I didn't have friends in high school
By the end of 12th grade, the pressure of entrance exam plus nobody who could understand me probably led to my depression
And I went to the internet to cope
went to a website called 7 cups
where I could vent out and people would just listen
I met someone (who's name I still don't know, I always called him foxy) who was a developer in some European country
it was really nice to see someone who'd actually listen to what I say not just for the sake of not making me feel bad
He also taught me how to use discord bots
And I wanted to be someone's foxy so I decided to be a listener on that platform too
Had a really bad experience which I didn't understand at that time but now it makes a lot of sense
I left the platform
Foxy left discord
we never talked again
I joined this tech youtuber's server
which at that time had 10k members
they have this coding channel
where one of the admins who is a software developer was really active
so I would just ask him a lot of coding questions
and I would ask a lot of hardware related questions on the other channels
because it was at that time I was planning to build my own PC
and I needed it to be really good
so I would make pcpp lists (pcpp is a website that helps you create PC list by adding up components and stuff, it's pretty cool) and ask the members to rate my list
I learnt a lot
I don't know where I am going with this honestly
So, JEE came
JEE = my entrance exam
I bombed it
like no college would take me
and at that time I was really against taking a gap year
just for a stupid entrance exam that I know I won't study for
So I convinced myself to apply for BCA or B.Sc (CS)
but my 12th grade marks (admission criteria for those degrees) were not enough either
It was funny how a lot of people who had no interest or knowledge about CS got into those "reputable institutes" to pursue CS
meanwhile I, someone whose only passion was CS, didn't have enough marks
My mum convinced my father to let me take a gap year because she couldn't see me pursue something I was not interested in
And I may have studied for like a month or two
but then I gave up
unsurprisingly
because I never liked those subjects
that were asked in entrance exam
I started spending more time on discord
found pcf
created spl
the rest is history
there were 2 attempts after my gap year
since it was a competitive exam, I luckily scored better than my "competitors"
in my first attempt
Got the result, 97.72 percentile
I knew I'd get something with this
even if that something isn't as great as the other options
or, as my father likes to say, "what I deserve"
I was just tired
I gave up totally
then covid happened
my second attempt was really bad
I think I got like a 49 percentile or sth
I just luckily stumbled upon this uni and found that they are opening a new specialization
in AI
and I always loved voice assistants and robots 
like the ones they show in movies
man I still have no idea where I am going with this and I really doubt you'll read these many messages
Anyways, my mother was happy that I would be able to do what I love
I was happy that I would probably finally find friends with same interest as me
but guess what
nobody fucking cares about tech here
they are all people who were forced by their parents because money
and I still have difficulty making friends
Although it's much better than school, I won't lie
because the people at school outright ignored me when I started geeking out
my "friends" at college just admire me
saying that how am I so passionate about tech
to the point I feel like this is really not normal behaviour and I should stop
but then I can't
When I was watching the kdrama
I just resonated with Mr. Yaoi hands a lot
Although he is too much of a goody two shoes
I am a bitch
I would never give up the chance of one-upping someone just because I feel guilty or sth
that's stupid
but his passion for technology
and when he said nobody likes him geeking out
And it's fine if people tell me that I am geeking out too much
I'm used to it
honestly, it's better if people stop me earlier than bear all the torture
My fairytale romance would really just be someone who's just as passionate about tech as me and respects my boundaries
I just realized
I took up a lot of hobbies to fit in
like quilling, those scooby wires, rubiks cube etc.
But I would always end up taking them later than I should
like when the trend was already gone
